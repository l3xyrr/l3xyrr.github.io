<p>
  What he doesn't know is, <p>
The ocean was still trying to be as beautiful as him, <p>
When it rained, <p>
The ocean was shedding all of its imperfections, <p>
To resemble his cries, <p>
Yet he danced in its tears so beautifully, <p>
The water dripping from his hair, <p>
The sultry look with shimmering eyes, <p>
Not a thought in his mind, <p>
That the water is a failed attempt from the ocean, <p>
To capture his beauty in the purest form.
