What he doesn't know is,
The ocean was still trying to be as beautiful as him,
When it rained,
The ocean was shedding all of its imperfections,
To resemble his cries,
Yet he danced in its tears so beautifully,
The water dripping from his hair,
The sultry look with shimmering eyes,
Not a thought in his mind,
That the water is a failed attempt from the ocean,
To capture his beauty in the purest form.
